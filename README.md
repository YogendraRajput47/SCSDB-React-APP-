🎬 Movie App – Frontend Domination Project

This repository contains a Movie App built as part of the Frontend Domination course by Sheriyans Coding School. The project focuses on strengthening core frontend development skills by implementing a real-world application that allows users to explore, search, and view details about movies.

The app is developed using React.js, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture, ensuring reusability, scalability, and maintainability. By working on this project, learners not only gain hands-on experience with React but also get comfortable with integrating third-party APIs, managing state, handling props, and applying responsive design principles to create a seamless user experience across devices.

✨ Key Features

Search Functionality: Users can easily search for movies by title.

Movie Details: Displays important information such as poster, title, description, release date, and rating.

Responsive Design: Optimized layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Dynamic UI: Interactive and visually appealing design to improve user engagement.

API Integration: Fetches real-time data from a movie API to keep content updated.
